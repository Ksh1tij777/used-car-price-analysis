# Used Car Price Analysis & Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the prices of used cars using scraped data from Cars24. It involves data scraping, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model building for price prediction.


## Features
- Web scraping car data (name, km driven, fuel type, location, EMI, etc.) using Selenium  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations  
- Feature engineering for improving model accuracy  
- Machine learning models to predict used car prices  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ksh1tij777/used-car-price-analysis.git
